# Baseball-PlayerType-Cluster
cluster analysis of players past and present

The data set contains MLB players from the past 100 years and the most relevant statistics to describe their overall performance. Players who donâ€™t meet a qualifying number of plate appearances are excluded from the data. The analysis will be used to determine what type of hitter the player is and how well they perform in that area versus other similar players.




The results show the different types of productive batters in MLB history.  Younger players could be plotted against the historical data to give analysts an idea of how they will perform in comparison to other players historically. This could also prove useful when comparing current great players to historically great players when talking about future Hall of Fame chances. A great example of this is seen on the plot where Babe Ruth is data point 1 and Future Hall of Famer Mike Trout is data point 22.  When organizations are making roster moves in the offseason, this analysis could provide insight on which available players would fit in with their current needs. An example could be when a team loses their leadoff hitter, they would use the analysis to look for similar or even better players whether that be from the free agent pool or their own minor league system. The analysis could be further refined by position as teams are unlikely to go after a hitter who plays a position they already have filled.
